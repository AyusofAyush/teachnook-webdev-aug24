# What is Javascript ?
```
JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
```

## Features of Javascript ?

There are following features of JavaScript:

1. All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
2. JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
3. JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
4. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
5. It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
6. It is a case-sensitive language.
7. JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
8. It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.


## Basic Application of JS (Basic)

- Client-side validation,
- Dynamic drop-down menus,
- Displaying date and time,
- Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
- Displaying clocks etc.
etc..


## Places to put JS Code in HTML
```
3 Places to put JavaScript code
1. Between the body tag of html
2. Between the head tag of html
3. In .js file (external javaScript)
```

## Pros/Cons of Using External JS file
```
Pros:
- reusability of code
- code readability
- time-efficient as web browsers can cache the external js
- devs can work with html and js files parallelly

Cons:
- the two files are dependent on each other if one goes wrong may affect another
- additional HTTP call to get js file
- code needs to be checked for code duplication 
- takes more time when debugging from multiple js files

```


## What is Hoisting in JS?

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and call functions before they are actually declared in your code.

For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;
```

In this code, even though the variable `x` is declared and assigned a value later in the code, the `console.log` statement does not throw an error. Instead, it prints `undefined`. This is because during hoisting, the variable declaration `var x` is moved to the top of its scope, but the assignment `x = 5` remains in its original position. So, when the `console.log` statement is executed, `x` exists but has not yet been assigned a value, resulting in `undefined` being printed.

It's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. So, if you try to access a variable before it is declared, you will get a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y = 10;
```

In this code, the `console.log` statement throws a `ReferenceError` because the variable `y` is declared using `let`, which does not hoist the variable declaration to the top of its scope. Therefore, `y` is not defined before the `console.log` statement.

Hoisting also applies to function declarations. Consider the following code:

```javascript
sayHello(); // Output: Hello!

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In this code, the `sayHello` function is called before it is actually declared. However, due to hoisting, the function declaration is moved to the top of its scope, allowing the function to be called successfully.

In conclusion, hoisting is a JavaScript behavior that allows you to use variables and call functions before they are declared in your code. However, it's important to understand how hoisting works to avoid unexpected behavior and potential bugs in your code.

## Basics of Javascript

Here's a comprehensive guide on JavaScript basics, complete with examples, targeting beginners:

### 1. Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language primarily used for web development. It allows you to create dynamic content on websites, such as interactive forms, animations, and other dynamic elements.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, JavaScript!";
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. Variables, Data Types, and Operators
Variables in JavaScript store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your code. JavaScript supports several data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Variables
let name = "Ayush";
const age = 25;
var isDeveloper = true;

// Data Types
let stringType = "Hello";
let numberType = 123;
let booleanType = true;
let objectType = { firstName: "Ayush", lastName: "Raj" };
let arrayType = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java"];

// Operators
let sum = 10 + 5;  // Addition
let difference = 10 - 5;  // Subtraction
let product = 10 * 5;  // Multiplication
let quotient = 10 / 5;  // Division
```

### 3. Functions and Control Structures
Functions in JavaScript allow you to group code together to perform a specific task. Control structures like if-else, switch, and loops help you control the flow of your code.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Functions
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Ayush"));

// Control Structures
let num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Positive number");
} else {
    console.log("Non-positive number");
}

let day = 3;
switch(day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Another day");
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration " + i);
}
```

### 4. Debugging Tools and Techniques
Debugging is essential for finding and fixing errors in your code. The browser's developer tools provide features like breakpoints and step-through debugging to help you.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Example with a breakpoint
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let result = x + y;  // Set a breakpoint here to inspect variables
console.log(result);
```
Use `console.log()` to print variables and check their values at different points in your code.

### 5. DOM Manipulation with JavaScript
The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a webpage. JavaScript allows you to manipulate the DOM to change the content, style, and structure of a webpage dynamically.

**Example:**
```javascript
// DOM Manipulation
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, JavaScript!";
document.getElementById("greeting").style.color = "blue";
```

### 6. Events and Event Listeners
Events in JavaScript are actions that occur on the webpage, such as clicks, mouse movements, or form submissions. Event listeners allow you to execute code in response to these events.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Event Listeners</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
    <p id="message"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "Button was clicked!";
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Additional Topics for Beginners

#### 7. Arrays and Objects
Arrays and objects are fundamental data structures in JavaScript.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Arrays
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[1]);  // Output: Banana

// Objects
let person = {
    firstName: "Ayush",
    lastName: "Raj",
    age: 25
};
console.log(person.firstName);  // Output: Ayush
```

#### 8. String Methods
Strings in JavaScript come with various methods to manipulate and work with text.

**Example:**
```javascript
let text = "JavaScript is fun!";
console.log(text.length);  // Output: 18
console.log(text.toUpperCase());  // Output: JAVASCRIPT IS FUN!
console.log(text.substring(0, 10));  // Output: JavaScript
```

#### 9. ES6 Features
ES6 introduced several new features to JavaScript, including let and const, arrow functions, template literals, and more.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Arrow Functions
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 3));  // Output: 8

// Template Literals
let name = "Ayush";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting);  // Output: Hello, Ayush!
```

#### 10. Fetch API
The Fetch API provides a way to make network requests to retrieve resources from the server.

**Example:**
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

This guide covers the essential basics of JavaScript, providing a solid foundation for beginners. Each section includes examples to help you understand and apply the concepts in your own projects.

## DOM Manipulations and Event & Event Listeners


## Javascript DOM
```
check app.js
```


## Javascript Form Validation
```
Check the form.html
```


## Javascript Events
```
check app.js 
```

## Javascript Cookies
```
A cookie is an amount of information that persists between a server-side and a client-side. A web browser stores this information at the time of browsing.

A cookie contains the information as a string generally in the form of a name-value pair separated by semi-colons. It maintains the state of a user and remembers the user's information among all the web pages.


- When a user sends a request to the server, then each of that request is treated as a new request sent by the different user.
- So, to recognize the old user, we need to add the cookie with the response from the server.
- browser at the client-side.
- Now, whenever a user sends a request to the server, the cookie is added with that request automatically. Due to the cookie, the server recognizes the users.
```

## Javascript Events
```
check app.js
```

`start in next session`

### JS closures


### JS Async
- JS Callback
- Promises
- Async Await

### JS Async programming

`Javascript Callbacks`

"I will call back later!"

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

This technique allows a function to call another function

A callback function can run after another function has finished

e.g.:

// Create an Array
const myNumbers = [4, 1, -20, -7, 5, 9, -6];

// Call removeNeg with a callback
const posNumbers = removeNeg(myNumbers, (x) => x >= 0);

// Display Result
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = posNumbers;

// Keep only positive numbers
function removeNeg(numbers, callback) {
  const myArray = [];
  for (const x of numbers) {
    if (callback(x)) {
      myArray.push(x);
    }
  }
  return myArray;
}


`Asynchronous JavaScript`

"I will finish later!"

Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

*FYI,refer `Event Loop`*

A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()

setInterval(myFunction, 1000);

function myFunction() {
  let d = new Date();
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=
  d.getHours() + ":" +
  d.getMinutes() + ":" +
  d.getSeconds();
}


`JavaScript Promises`

"I Promise a Result!"

"Producing code" is code that can take some time

"Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

A Promise is an Object that links Producing code and Consuming code



Promise Object Properties
A JavaScript Promise object can be:

- Pending
- Fulfilled
- Rejected


myPromise.state	        myPromise.result
"pending"	                undefined
"fulfilled"	                a result value
"rejected"	                an error object

e.g:

function myDisplayer(some) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
}

let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  let x = 0;

// The producing code (this may take some time)

  if (x == 0) {
    resolve("OK");
  } else {
    reject("Error");
  }
});

// how to consume it ?

myPromise
  .then((value) => {
    myDisplayer(value)
    return 'another-value';
    }
  )
  .then((value) => {
    console.log('Another value', value);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    myDisplayer(error)
  }
);


`JavaScript Async Await`

"async and await make promises easier to write"

async makes a function return a Promise

await makes a function wait for a Promise


e.g.:

async function getFile() {
  let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve) {
    let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('GET', "mycar.html");
    req.onload = function() {
      if (req.status == 200) {
        resolve(req.response);
      } else {
        resolve("File not Found");
      }
    };
    req.send();
  });
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = await myPromise;
}

getFile();

## Recap

#### 1. **Functions and Control Structures**
   - **Defining and Invoking Functions**:
     Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that execute specific tasks. There are multiple ways to define a function:
     ```javascript
     // Function Declaration
     function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
     }

     // Function Expression
     const multiply = function(a, b) {
       return a * b;
     };

     // Arrow Function (ES6+)
     const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

     // Invoking functions
     console.log(add(3, 4)); // Output: 7
     console.log(multiply(5, 6)); // Output: 30
     ```

   - **Control Structures: if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)**:
     Control structures manage the flow of execution in your code.

     - **If-Else**: Executes code blocks conditionally.
       ```javascript
       const num = 10;
       if (num > 5) {
         console.log('Number is greater than 5');
       } else {
         console.log('Number is less than or equal to 5');
       }
       ```

     - **Switch**: Used when you have multiple conditions to check.
       ```javascript
       const day = 2;
       switch (day) {
         case 1:
           console.log('Monday');
           break;
         case 2:
           console.log('Tuesday');
           break;
         default:
           console.log('Another day');
       }
       ```

     - **Loops**: Repeat a block of code.

       - **For Loop**:
         ```javascript
         for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
           console.log(i);
         }
         ```

       - **While Loop**:
         ```javascript
         let i = 0;
         while (i < 5) {
           console.log(i);
           i++;
         }
         ```

       - **Do-While Loop**: Executes the block at least once.
         ```javascript
         let j = 0;
         do {
           console.log(j);
           j++;
         } while (j < 5);
         ```

#### 2. **Debugging Tools and Techniques**
   - **Console and Debugging Tools in Browsers**:
     Modern browsers come with built-in developer tools, accessible by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" (or pressing `F12`).
     - **Console**: You can log output or errors for debugging.
       ```javascript
       console.log('This is a log message');
       console.error('This is an error message');
       ```
     - **Breakpoints**: You can pause code execution at specific lines to inspect variables and step through the code.
     - **Watch Expressions**: Allows you to monitor specific variables as you debug.

   - **Common Debugging Practices**:
     - **Using `console.log`** to print variables and messages for debugging.
     - **Error Handling**: Use `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors.
       ```javascript
       try {
         let result = someUndefinedFunction();
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('An error occurred:', error);
       }
       ```
     - **Browser Developer Tools**: Use the "Sources" tab to inspect files, set breakpoints, and debug.

### Example of JavaScript Form Validation

This example demonstrates how to validate a simple HTML form using JavaScript. The script checks if the user input is valid when the form is submitted (e.g., checking if fields are empty or meet specific criteria).

#### HTML and JavaScript for Form Validation
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Form Validation</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Form Validation Example</h1>
  <form id="myForm">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
    <br><br>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <br><br>

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
    <br><br>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <p id="error-message" style="color:red;"></p>
  </form>

  <script>
    document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
      event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
      
      // Get form values
      const username = document.getElementById('username').value;
      const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
      const password = document.getElementById('password').value;

      // Validate the inputs
      let errorMessage = '';
      
      if (username === '') {
        errorMessage += 'Username is required.<br>';
      }
      if (!email.includes('@')) {
        errorMessage += 'Email must be valid.<br>';
      }
      if (password.length < 6) {
        errorMessage += 'Password must be at least 6 characters long.<br>';
      }

      // Show error message or submit form
      const errorDisplay = document.getElementById('error-message');
      if (errorMessage) {
        errorDisplay.innerHTML = errorMessage;
      } else {
        errorDisplay.innerHTML = '';
        alert('Form submitted successfully!');
        // Here, you can add logic to submit the form data via AJAX or another method.
      }
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Explanation:
- **HTML Form**: Contains inputs for username, email, and password.
- **JavaScript Validation**:
  - Listens for the form’s `submit` event.
  - Retrieves the input values using `document.getElementById`.
  - Checks if:
    - The username is empty.
    - The email contains "@".
    - The password is at least 6 characters long.
  - Displays appropriate error messages if validation fails. If successful, it shows an alert and submits the form.

This example provides a basic introduction to client-side form validation using JavaScript and how to improve the user experience with real-time feedback.
