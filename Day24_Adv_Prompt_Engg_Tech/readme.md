### **1. Few-Shot Prompting**

Few-shot prompting involves giving the model a few examples to set the pattern or context for the desired response. This is especially useful for guiding the model to produce output in a specific style or format.

#### **Example: Categorizing Customer Feedback**

**Task**: Classify customer feedback as “Positive,” “Negative,” or “Neutral.”

**Prompt**:
```
Classify the sentiment of these customer feedback examples:

1. "I love the product! It’s exactly what I needed and works perfectly." -> Positive
2. "The product is okay, but the delivery took too long." -> Neutral
3. "The quality is poor, and I wouldn’t buy from here again." -> Negative

Now classify the following:
4. "The item is decent, but the packaging was damaged on arrival."
```

**Output**:
```
Neutral
```

*This example uses a few examples to help the model learn the pattern of classification, which it then applies to new input.*

### **2. Inferring Prompt**

Inferring prompts are used to extract information or make interpretations based on given text. This can involve sentiment analysis, intent recognition, topic extraction, etc.

#### **Example: Inferring Intent from User Query**

**Task**: Determine if a user query is a “Question,” “Request,” or “Complaint.”

**Prompt**:
```
Identify the intent of the following user query:

"Can you check if my order has been shipped yet?"

Intent:
```

**Output**:
```
Question
```

*This prompt is designed to extract the intent from user text, which is useful for customer support applications to route messages appropriately.*

### **5. Conditional Prompting**

Conditional prompting allows the model to adapt its response based on conditions or context provided in the prompt, useful in chatbots or customer service applications.

#### **Example: Customer Support Chatbot Response**

**Task**: Respond to a customer query based on whether it’s about shipping, returns, or product availability.

**Prompt**:
```
If the customer asks about “shipping,” respond with: “Shipping typically takes 5–7 business days.”
If the customer asks about “returns,” respond with: “We offer a 30-day return policy.”
If the customer asks about “product availability,” respond with: “Let me check our inventory for this item.”

Query: "How long does it take for items to ship?"
```

**Output**:
```
"Shipping typically takes 5–7 business days."
```

*Conditional prompting makes the response specific to the user’s intent, making interactions feel more personalized and context-aware.*

---

### **6. Controlled Output with Parameters**

By adjusting parameters like **temperature**, **max tokens**, and **frequency penalty**, you can control the style, length, and repetitiveness of responses. This is useful for generating responses that need to be concise or creative depending on the use case.

#### **Example: Creating a Product Tagline**

**Task**: Generate a creative tagline for an eco-friendly water bottle brand.

### **7. Role-Based Prompting (Specialized Tone/Style)**

This technique is useful when you want the AI to assume a specific role or tone, such as responding as a “financial expert” or “support agent.” This can enhance engagement by aligning with the intended tone.

#### **Example: Role-Based Financial Advice**

**Task**: Respond to a query about investing in stocks, with the AI acting as a financial advisor.

**Prompt**:
```
As a financial advisor, respond to the following question: “Is investing in stocks a good idea for long-term savings?”

Response:
```

**Output**:
```
"Investing in stocks can be an excellent option for long-term savings, as it historically offers higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts. However, it’s important to consider your risk tolerance and diversify your portfolio to minimize potential losses."
```

*Role-based prompting is effective for applications where specific expertise or tone is needed, such as educational platforms, customer support, or professional services.*

     - **Temperature**: Lower values make the AI more deterministic (better for structured, factual tasks), while higher values increase creativity.
     - **Max Tokens**: Sets the response length, useful for generating summaries or concise answers.
     - **Frequency Penalty**: Reduces repetition, ideal for generating varied responses in creative applications.
   
   - **Example**: 
     - **Prompt**: “Describe a luxury smartwatch in 3 sentences.”
     - **Parameters**: Set `temperature` to 0.7 for a slightly creative response, `max tokens` to 50 to limit length.

3. **Conditional Prompting**:
   - Create prompts that adjust responses based on user conditions. These are useful in chatbots and personalized assistants that cater responses to user input.
   
   - **Example**: 
      - **Prompt**: “If the user is asking about ‘shipping’, provide shipping time estimates. If they are asking about ‘returns’, explain the return policy.”
      - **Input**: “What is your return policy?”
      - **Output**: “We offer a 30-day return policy. Just keep the original packaging and receipt!”

4. **Few-Shot and One-Shot Prompting**:
   - Provide a few examples of desired responses in the prompt to guide the AI’s output. Particularly helpful for structured data extraction, intent recognition, and classification.
   
   - **Example**:
      - **Prompt**: “Classify these statements as ‘Positive’, ‘Neutral’, or ‘Negative’. Example: ‘The service was excellent!’ -> Positive.”
      - **Input**: “The delivery was delayed, but the product is great.”
      - **Output**: “Neutral”
