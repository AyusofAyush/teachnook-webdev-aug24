### Step 2: Choosing a Theme (Design) for Your Store

3. **Set the Price**:

   - Add **SKU** (Stock Keeping Unit) numbers if you have them. This is optional but useful for inventory tracking.

4. **Inventory and Shipping**:

3. **Packaging and Labels**:

### Step 6: Launching the Store

1. **Review and Launch**:
   - Double-check your products, payment settings, and shipping options to ensure everything is correct.

2. **Upgrade to a Paid Plan**:
   - To make your store public, you need to select a Shopify plan. The **Basic Plan** is sufficient for small businesses, but explore other options if you expect higher sales volume.
