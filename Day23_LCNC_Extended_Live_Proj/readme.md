### Code Examples and Output

#### Example Bubble Workflow for AI Integration

Here’s a sample setup in Bubble using the API connector:

1. **API Request**:
   ```json
   {
     "method": "POST",
     "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-003/completions",
     "headers": {
       "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     },
     "body": {
       "prompt": "Write a blog post about {{Input Topic}}",
       "temperature": 0.7,
       "max_tokens": 600
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Bubble Workflow Action**:
   - Set up the “Generate Blog” button to trigger this API call, and configure a workflow to display the response in the text box area on the page.

#### Example Custom JavaScript Code in Webflow (for direct API calls)

In Webflow, custom code can be added to the page settings:

```html
<script>
async function generateBlogPost() {
  const topic = document.getElementById('topicInput').value;
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-003/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prompt: `Write a blog post about ${topic}`,
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 600
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  document.getElementById('outputContainer').innerText = data.choices[0].text;
}
</script>
```

In the Webflow UI, add an “onclick” attribute to the Generate button to call `generateBlogPost()`.
