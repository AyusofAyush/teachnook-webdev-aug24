# Debugging Techniques and Tools Effective debugging strategies Using browser developer tools

Debugging is a crucial skill for developers to identify, track down, and fix issues in both frontend and backend applications. Here’s a guide that can help you teach your mentees to approach debugging effectively using browser developer tools and other strategies.

#### 1. **Understanding the Types of Bugs**
   - **Syntax Errors**: Mistakes in the code that cause it not to run.
   - **Logic Errors**: Code runs but does not behave as expected.
   - **Runtime Errors**: Errors that happen while the program is executing.

#### 2. **General Debugging Techniques**
   - **Reproduce the Bug**: Always try to reproduce the bug first. Document the steps so you know when the bug occurs.
   - **Isolate the Issue**: Narrow down the part of the code where the issue arises. Use comments, conditional statements, or by breaking your code into smaller parts to test.
   - **Check Recent Changes**: Focus on the most recent changes in the codebase, especially if the bug wasn’t present before.
   - **Console Logs**: Use `console.log()` statements to print variable values and confirm assumptions about code behavior.
   - **Step-by-Step Execution**: Use breakpoints to examine code execution line by line.

### Debugging Frontend Web Applications

#### **Browser Developer Tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools, etc.)**

1. **Inspect Element (DOM and CSS Debugging)**
   - Use the **Elements** tab to view and edit the DOM and see how CSS rules apply to elements.
   - Modify styles directly in the browser to test changes quickly.

2. **Console (JavaScript Debugging)**
   - Utilize the **Console** tab to check for JavaScript errors, warnings, and custom logs.
   - Use `console.table()` for better visibility of object data.

3. **Breakpoints (JavaScript Code Execution)**
   - The **Sources** tab allows you to set breakpoints in your JavaScript code.
   - Breakpoints stop code execution at specific lines so you can inspect variables and step through your code.

4. **Network (API Calls and Performance Monitoring)**
   - The **Network** tab lets you inspect HTTP requests and responses, including status codes, headers, and payloads.
   - Use it to debug API issues, verify if requests are being sent and received as expected.

5. **React DevTools, Vue DevTools, Angular DevTools**
   - Use specific dev tools for React, Vue, and Angular to inspect the component hierarchy, state, and props.
   - **React DevTools**: Inspect the component tree and view state/props for each component.
   - **Vue DevTools**: Similar to React, with additional Vue-specific options like reactivity tracking.
   - **Angular DevTools**: Focus on the component structure and data binding.

---

### Debugging React, Angular, and Vue Applications

1. **React:**
   - **React Developer Tools**: Inspect component trees and state, track component re-renders, and look at props being passed down.
   - **Console Logs in Functional Components**: For React hooks, print the state and props to understand changes during renders.
   - **Check Component Keys**: When using lists, improper key usage can cause re-rendering bugs.

2. **Angular:**
   - **Augury**: A Chrome extension for debugging Angular applications. Use it to visualize the component tree and module structure.
   - **Inspecting Services**: If the issue stems from data or service logic, debug the services that provide data to the components.

3. **Vue:**
   - **Vue DevTools**: Inspect the component tree, watch state changes, and track event emission.
   - **Vue Console Logs**: Vue emits lots of helpful messages. Use `console.log` to track `props` and `computed` properties to ensure data is passed correctly.

---

### Debugging Backend Applications

#### Debugging Django, Express, and Other Backend Frameworks

1. **Check Server Logs**:
   - Logs in Django and Express often provide the first clues to runtime errors. Use built-in logging mechanisms to track the flow of your application.
   - For Django: Use `print()` or `logging` module for output.
   - For Express: Use `console.log()` or third-party logging tools like `morgan`.

2. **Debugger Tools:**
   - **Python PDB for Django**: Python’s built-in debugger, `pdb`, lets you inspect variables, set breakpoints, and step through code.
   - **Node.js Debugger for Express**: Use the Node.js debugger (`node inspect`) or Chrome DevTools to debug Node.js code. Place `debugger` statements in the code to pause execution.

3. **Check API Responses:**
   - Use Postman or curl to check if API endpoints return the correct data.
   - Ensure the backend server is receiving and returning the expected data format.

4. **Database Queries Debugging:**
   - In Django: Use `django.db.connection.queries` to view SQL queries made by the ORM.
   - In Express (with MongoDB): Use Mongoose’s `debug` mode or log queries manually to track data interactions.

5. **Check Environment Configuration:**
   - Ensure proper environment variables are set (like `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY` in Django, or `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET` in Express).
   - Use `.env` files for configuration, but check that they're loaded correctly in development and production environments.

---

### Debugging Workflow Recommendations

1. **Frontend:**
   - **Start with the console**: Look for JavaScript errors and logs.
   - **Use the Network tab**: Ensure API calls are successful and returning expected data.
   - **Apply breakpoints**: Step through the code in the Sources tab to find issues.
   - **React/Vue DevTools**: Inspect component state and props to ensure they match expectations.

2. **Backend:**
   - **Check server logs**: Errors will often surface here first.
   - **Test endpoints with Postman**: Ensure APIs work as expected by simulating client requests.
   - **Use debuggers**: Whether it's Python’s PDB or Node’s debugger, step through the server code.
   - **Check the database**: If your app interacts with a database, make sure queries return the expected results.

---

### Tools & Extensions

1. **Visual Studio Code Debugger**
   - For JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, VSCode has an excellent built-in debugger that integrates with both frontend and backend code.

2. **Postman**
   - A powerful tool to test API requests and responses.

3. **Mongoose Debug Mode** (For Express/MongoDB)
   - Enables you to view all MongoDB queries made by your application.

4. **Redux DevTools** (For React + Redux)
   - Allows you to inspect the state and actions dispatched in your Redux store.

---

### Final Tips for Debugging:
   - **Emphasize Experimentation**: Debugging is a trial-and-error process. Test code constantly.
   - **Collaborate on Complex Bugs**: Some bugs are difficult to solve alone. Seek help or pair program to debug complex issues.
   - **Stay Calm and Methodical**: Debugging can be frustrating. Remain calm, break the problem into smaller pieces, and tackle each one logically.

By using these strategies and tools, you will build strong debugging skills that will improve their problem-solving and troubleshooting abilities in both frontend and backend development.

## Google Dev Tools Exploration 


Google Chrome’s DevTools is an indispensable suite of tools for debugging and optimizing web applications. Below is a breakdown of each tab in Chrome DevTools and how it can assist in debugging various aspects of your application:

### 1. **Elements Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Inspect and modify the HTML and CSS of your page in real-time.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **DOM Inspection**: See the structure of the HTML elements on the page. This is helpful for understanding how elements are nested and finding specific elements quickly.
     - **Live CSS Editing**: You can modify CSS styles directly here and see the changes immediately, without reloading the page. This is useful for debugging layout issues.
     - **Event Listeners**: You can view and remove event listeners attached to elements to debug issues with user interactions.
     - **Modify Attributes**: Directly edit attributes (like `class`, `id`, `src`) in the HTML to test changes on the fly.
     - **Inspect Pseudo-elements**: You can see `::before`, `::after` pseudo-elements and adjust styles for them.

   - **Example**: If an element isn't styled as expected, you can use this tab to see which CSS rules are being applied or overwritten.

### 2. **Console Tab**
   - **Purpose**: View error messages, warnings, and log custom outputs.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Error and Warning Messages**: Any JavaScript errors or warnings will appear here. It is a great first step when debugging issues related to script execution.
     - **Running JavaScript**: You can execute JavaScript directly in the console. This is useful for testing code snippets without having to modify your source files.
     - **Custom Logs**: Developers can add `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, or `console.error()` statements in their code to print variable values or trace execution. This is great for debugging variables and logic.
     - **View Network Status**: Check if the application is failing to connect to the internet, especially if there are network-related issues.

   - **Example**: Use `console.log()` to check the value of a variable at different points during code execution.

### 3. **Sources Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Inspect, edit, and debug JavaScript code.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints in your JavaScript code to pause execution at specific lines. This helps track down where things are going wrong.
     - **Call Stack**: While debugging, the call stack shows you the execution order of functions. You can see how the program arrived at the current execution point.
     - **Step Through Code**: Once a breakpoint is hit, you can step through your code line-by-line to examine variable states and program flow.
     - **Watch Expressions**: Track specific expressions or variables while debugging.
     - **Local Modifications**: You can make temporary edits to JavaScript files and test code without having to reload the page.

   - **Example**: If a function is behaving unexpectedly, you can add a breakpoint and step through the function to see how the state changes.

### 4. **Network Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Monitor network activity like API requests, responses, and load times.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Inspect API Calls**: See all HTTP requests being made, their status codes (like 200 or 404), and their payloads. You can check if API requests are failing or returning incorrect data.
     - **Inspect Responses**: Examine the response bodies of network requests to ensure they are formatted as expected.
     - **Check for Caching Issues**: Verify if assets like JavaScript and CSS files are being cached correctly.
     - **Simulate Network Conditions**: Test how your app behaves on different network speeds (like 3G or offline mode).

   - **Example**: If an API call is failing, the Network tab can show whether the request is reaching the server and what response (if any) is returned.

### 5. **Performance Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Measure the performance of your application, including load times, responsiveness, and rendering.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Record Performance**: You can record your website’s performance during specific actions, such as clicking a button or loading a page.
     - **CPU Usage**: Track CPU usage during performance recording to find out if there are bottlenecks in your application.
     - **Frames and Rendering**: Analyze how long it takes for each frame of your website to render. This is crucial for debugging performance issues.
     - **Optimize Paint Operations**: You can see how often the browser is re-painting elements and identify which parts of the page are causing performance issues.

   - **Example**: If your app feels slow, you can record its performance to identify potential bottlenecks, like long paint times or expensive JavaScript functions.

### 6. **Memory Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Detect memory leaks and monitor how much memory your application is using.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Heap Snapshots**: Take a snapshot of the memory usage to analyze which objects are consuming the most memory. This helps to find memory leaks or unnecessary object creation.
     - **Garbage Collection**: Analyze how the browser's garbage collection is freeing up memory and whether objects are being retained unnecessarily.
     - **Allocation Timelines**: View memory allocations over time to find out if there is an excessive memory build-up that could indicate a memory leak.

   - **Example**: If your app is using more memory over time (especially single-page applications), the Memory tab can help you find where memory isn't being released properly.

### 7. **Application Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Inspect storage and other resources used by your application, including cookies, localStorage, and service workers.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Local Storage & Session Storage**: View and manipulate the data stored in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
     - **Cookies**: Inspect and modify the cookies used by your website. Check expiry, value, and domain details for each cookie.
     - **IndexedDB & WebSQL**: For more complex client-side databases, you can inspect and modify the stored data.
     - **Service Workers**: Check if service workers are registered and working correctly for Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and offline capabilities.
     - **Manifest**: Inspect the app manifest for PWA applications and ensure it’s correctly configured.

   - **Example**: If your app is supposed to save data to `localStorage`, but it isn’t working, you can inspect the local storage to see what's stored and troubleshoot the issue.

### 8. **Security Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Inspect the security status of your website.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **SSL/TLS Inspection**: Check if your website has a valid SSL certificate and whether all resources (like images and scripts) are loaded securely (without mixed content).
     - **Identify Mixed Content**: If some elements are loaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS, this tab will show warnings, allowing you to secure them.

   - **Example**: If users are seeing "This site is not secure" warnings, the Security tab will show you the status of your certificate and help you find any mixed content.

### 9. **Lighthouse Tab**
   - **Purpose**: Run automated audits to measure performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Run Audits**: Generate a report that grades your app on various criteria like performance, accessibility, and best practices.
     - **Optimize Performance**: The audit report gives suggestions on how to improve page speed, including deferring JavaScript, image optimization, and server response times.
     - **Improve Accessibility**: Lighthouse checks for common accessibility issues like insufficient color contrast and missing `alt` attributes.
     - **SEO**: Get recommendations to improve your app’s SEO based on metadata, link tags, and structured data.

   - **Example**: If your app feels sluggish or performs poorly on mobile devices, Lighthouse can provide suggestions to improve performance and user experience.

## Testing UI Application using Jest 

Here’s a React application designed as a minor project to help your mentees understand testing using **Jest** and simulating various debugging scenarios in **Chrome DevTools**. This project will cover:

- Basic UI component creation
- Testing React components with **Jest**
- Simulating DevTools debugging techniques like DOM inspection, console logging, network monitoring, and more

### Project Overview: **Todo List Application**

**Features**:
- Add and remove tasks from a list.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Simulate network request for fetching tasks.
- Covering React state management and UI rendering.

### Setting Up the React Application

1. **Create a New React App**

```bash
npx create-react-app react-testing-todo
cd react-testing-todo
npm install
```

2. **Install Jest (if not already included)**

Jest comes pre-installed with Create React App, but if you want to install it separately:

```bash
npm install jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom --save-dev
```

---

### Step 1: Create the Todo App UI

Edit the `src/App.js` to build the basic UI for a Todo list.

```jsx
// src/App.js

import React, { useState } from "react";
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const [task, setTask] = useState("");
  
  const addTodo = () => {
    if (task.trim()) {
      setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text: task, completed: false }]);
      setTask("");
    }
  };

  const toggleComplete = (id) => {
    setTodos(
      todos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    );
  };

  const removeTodo = (id) => {
    setTodos(todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Enter task"
        value={task}
        onChange={(e) => setTask(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Task</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id} className={todo.completed ? "completed" : ""}>
            <span onClick={() => toggleComplete(todo.id)}>{todo.text}</span>
            <button onClick={() => removeTodo(todo.id)}>Remove</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Basic Styling (Optional)

Create a simple `src/App.css` to add some basic styling:

```css
/* src/App.css */
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.completed {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

---

### Step 2: Write Tests for the Todo Application using Jest

Now, we’ll create unit tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected. This will demonstrate how to write tests using **Jest** and simulate DOM manipulation and state updates.

Create a test file `src/App.test.js`:

```jsx
// src/App.test.js

import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";

test("renders the app", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const titleElement = screen.getByText(/todo list/i);
  expect(titleElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("adds a task", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const inputElement = screen.getByPlaceholderText("Enter task");
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText("Add Task");

  fireEvent.change(inputElement, { target: { value: "Learn Jest" } });
  fireEvent.click(buttonElement);

  const todoItem = screen.getByText("Learn Jest");
  expect(todoItem).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("toggles task completion", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const inputElement = screen.getByPlaceholderText("Enter task");
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText("Add Task");

  fireEvent.change(inputElement, { target: { value: "Learn React" } });
  fireEvent.click(buttonElement);

  const todoItem = screen.getByText("Learn React");
  fireEvent.click(todoItem); // Toggle completion

  expect(todoItem).toHaveClass("completed");
});

test("removes a task", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const inputElement = screen.getByPlaceholderText("Enter task");
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText("Add Task");

  fireEvent.change(inputElement, { target: { value: "Learn Testing" } });
  fireEvent.click(buttonElement);

  const todoItem = screen.getByText("Learn Testing");
  const removeButton = screen.getByText("Remove");

  fireEvent.click(removeButton); // Remove task
  expect(todoItem).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Step 3: Running the Tests

To run the tests, simply use:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the Jest test runner and execute your tests, providing instant feedback on any failures.

---

### Step 4: Testing Simulation and Chrome DevTools Integration

Use the following examples to guide your mentees on how to simulate different debugging scenarios using Chrome DevTools:

#### 1. **Console Logs and JavaScript Debugging**

- **Console Log Simulation**:
  Add `console.log()` statements in various parts of the code to trace the flow.

  Example:
  ```jsx
  const addTodo = () => {
    if (task.trim()) {
      console.log("Adding Task:", task); // Log task before adding
      setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text: task, completed: false }]);
      setTask("");
    }
  };
  ```

- **Debugging State Issues**:
  Teach mentees to set breakpoints in the **Sources** tab to pause the code execution and inspect state at specific points, like when tasks are added or completed.

#### 2. **DOM Inspection with the Elements Tab**

- Open the **Elements** tab in Chrome DevTools, inspect the DOM structure, and demonstrate how CSS changes can be tested in real-time without reloading the page.
- Show how to check for proper class application (e.g., the `.completed` class when a task is completed).

#### 3. **Network Tab to Simulate API Requests (Mock)**

- Simulate an API request for fetching tasks. You can mock this in the app using `setTimeout()` or by using a real API service in the future.

  Modify the `useEffect` to simulate fetching tasks on component load:
  ```jsx
  React.useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setTodos([{ id: 1, text: "Fetched Task", completed: false }]);
    }, 1000); // Simulate a 1s delay
  }, []);
  ```

- Open the **Network** tab to show how this "API request" would appear in real-time.

#### 4. **Using Breakpoints in the Sources Tab**

- Set breakpoints inside `addTodo`, `toggleComplete`, and `removeTodo` to show mentees how execution can be paused at any point to examine the state, call stack, and more.

#### 5. **Simulating Performance Bottlenecks**

- Add inefficient code (like unnecessary re-renders) to simulate performance issues. Teach mentees how to use the **Performance** tab to analyze how tasks are affecting performance.
